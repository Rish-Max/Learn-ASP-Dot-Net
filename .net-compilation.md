## .NET Execution & Compilation Model

.NET languages (C#, F#, VB.NET) follow a two-stage compilation process:

1. **Source Code → CIL**  
   Language-specific compilers convert source code into **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**, a platform-independent bytecode.

2. **CIL → Native Code**  
   At runtime, the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** uses a **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** to translate CIL into native machine code for the current OS and CPU.

This approach enables cross-platform execution, language interoperability, runtime optimizations, and managed services like garbage collection and security.

### Key Components

- **CIL (Common Intermediate Language)**: Platform-independent intermediate code
- **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**: Executes code and manages memory, threading, and security
- **JIT Compiler**: Converts CIL to optimized native machine code at runtime
